# Final Project
...Will need to insert something here...possibly the overview...
<br>

## Overview
English is considered one of the hardest langauages to learn. For English Language Learners (ELLs), the road to fluency is paved with challenges. Thankfully, many public schools offer language assitance programs to ensure that children speaking another langauage can attain English proficiency. In fall 2019, "Texas reported the highest percentage of ELs among its public school students (19.6 percent)" (1). The purpose of this project is to analyze the academic progress (math, reading) of English Language Learners in Harris County Texas.
