**Update based on David's feedback...can also be added to intro**
<br>
<br>
David: "the stated focus is on Harris County, though in the group check-ins we discussed possibly expanding that to other counties in the state; the extreme being all counties.."
<br>
Our response: "Originally we were going to analyze data from one district in Texas; we were encouraged to expand our analysis to the whole county to enrichen our data vizualization and create a robust database. We decided to focus only on one county because of time constraints. However, long-term, we hope to incorporate all county data in our analysis. Our database includes all schools within Harris County, Texas."

**We should come up with a time limit for each secion & develop drafts of what we'll say for each**

Presentation:

Introducing data & cleaning (<1min)
- where you got the data
- edas
- how we are storing the data
- mention formatting (vba, jupyter notebook, SQL to combinded data)

Potential speakers: Adeeba/Shah/Angela

*Jupyter Notebook makes collaborating easier and it supports multiple languages, is compatible with various tools and applications, and offers open-source and cloud-based programming.*
<br>
<br>
<br>

Data Visualization

Potential speakers: Sofia/Shah/Miracle
<br>
<br>
<br>

Machine learning (>2min)
- linear regression (make sure x value have a linear relationship to your y values)
- make simple scatter plots and see if there is any correlation or relationship, if you can't draw a line between them, then it won't work
- Potential speakers: Adeeba/Shah/Angela

Database -- Description Overview
- Use [python/excel] to clean, prepare, and explore the data and to complete the initial analysis. 
- Use database integration (Postgres, MongoDB, or SQLite) to store the data. 
- Use Python libraries. Tableau, and JavaScript libraries—like Data-Driven Documents (D3) and Plotly—to create visuals that help tell your data story.
- Use tools like Tableau or JavaScript to build a dashboard that presents your results
